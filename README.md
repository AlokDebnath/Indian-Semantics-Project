# Basic Characteristics
In order to consider the words to make an ontology, I divide the words into their basic parts of speech. I will refine it further by making an XML file.

# Objects (Real and Abstract)
Consists of objects, people, abstract emotions and the like.

## Perceivable Objects
Those objects that can be perceived by the sense are considered as percievable objects. *Pala*, *Svan* and so on.

## Abstract Objects
These objects are not perceived by the senses, they are abstract in nature. *Darma* and so on.

# Actions
Consists of actions and motions.

# Modifiers
Consists of words that modify objects and actions.

## Object Modifiers
Words that modify objects by assigning a property to them.

## Action Modifiers
Words which modify actions by assigning a property to them.

# Others
Words will not all be nouns, verbs and modifiers. Those words are placed here.
